## Our Team's Mission

The City of Boston's Analytics Team uses data and technology to make life better for everyone who lives and works in Boston. Mayor Walsh created our team in 2015 with the goal of developing innovative programs and improving performance across all parts of City government. Our work helps tackle many of Boston's greatest challenges, from public health and education to transit access and economic mobility, and our team plays a key role in major City initiatives such as Imagine Boston 2030 and Vision Zero. We also support departments throughout the City by providing tools, infrastructure, and expertise to empower every City program to make data a central part of their day-to-day workflows.
