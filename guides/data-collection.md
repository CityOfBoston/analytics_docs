## Survey Writing

#### Come up with a key and clear goal for your survey

Once you have a clear goal of what it is you are trying to achieve from your survey, it will be easier to figure out what data you need and what questions need to be answered. While going through the survey writing process, this is a great reference point to continue to check in on.

#### When collecting a number of demographic questions, try to keep these at the end

Survey takers can be hesitant to share too much demographic data. So if you need any of this information, ask your other questions first to build up trust and interest in the survey topic. After that, include the demographic questions that you need, and only the ones that you need.

#### Be as brief as possible

If someone opens up a long survey, or a survey is taking up too much of their time, they are not going to complete that survey. Make sure questions and response options are direct and you only ask as many questions as you need to.

#### Keep the order of the questions in mind

If you have questions with varying levels of complexity, don't start with the more complex ones. If the first few questions are too difficult or require too much thinking, a survey taker might bail on the survey. But if the first few questions are simpler, they are more likely to get into the flow of taking the survey.

#### Keep language simple for the intended audience

Make sure the language of all questions is simple for all survey-takers to understand. For example, if the intended audience is outside of DoIT, it makes sense to leave out any [technical jargon](employee-handbook/getting-started.md#doit-terminology-survival-guide) they might not be familiar with. Also, beware of acronyms - don't assume that your audience will understand any/all acronyms used.

#### Ask direct questions that can't be interpreted in a number of different ways

Sometimes questions can be worded poorly or are vague and confusing. Make sure questions are direct and can't be misinterpreted.

#### Make sure every question is necessary

It can often be helpful to figure out what data points you are going to need to achieve your goals of the survey. From there, ask questions that will get you to these data points. As referenced above, the survey should be brief, so only keep questions that are necessary.

#### Don't ask leading / biased questions

When asking someone what they think about something, don't give your opinion or influence the survey taker. For example, if we're trying to learn more about how departments felt about interactions with the Analytics team, don't ask things like "How much do you agree that the awesome Analytics team saved my department time?" and instead ask "How much do you agree or disagree that the Analytics team saved my department time?"

#### Use closed-ended questions as often as possible

Not only are closed-ended questions easier for survey takers to answer, they will also give you better / easier to analyze data. Obviously, in some situations open-ended questions are unavoidable, but if possible, turn into a close-ended question.

#### Use scales in questions where possible

Instead of asking a survey taker if they agree, use a scale of how much they agree/disagree. For example, instead of using something like "Do you agree that the City of Boston cares about my needs?", use "How much do you agree or disagree that the City of Boston cares about my needs?" This should take the place of true/false and yes/no questions wherever possible.

#### Keep response choices balanced

When you include a scaled question - make sure that the options are balanced. Don't use something like: "Strongly Agree; Agree; Neutral: Disagree" - make sure it's balanced on both sides: "Strongly Agree; Agree; Neutral; Disagree; Strongly Disagree"

#### When using scales, try to be consistent with scales throughout the survey

If you are using multiple scale questions throughout the survey, try to format them the same and include the same number of response options as much as possible. So if you have three questions asking how much the survey taker agrees with something, don't have two of those questions have 5 options and the last one has 7. Keep them all with the same number of response options as much as possible.

#### Don't ask double-barreled questions

Make sure that each question you ask is only asking one specific thing. Don't combine two different subjects into one question to save space, because you won't actually know what the survey is answering for. For example, don't ask "How often do you use the Analytics team form and office hours?" This should be split up into two different questions, so you know how often the survey taker is using each of those tools.

#### Avoid absolutes

Sometimes a survey will say something like: "Do you always check your data?" with options for yes and no. But someone might usually check it, but not necessarily always, so they may not know how to answer. Instead, ask them how often they check their data.

#### Make sure there is a response option for every person

There are often times where a question may not be relevant to a survey taker. In that event, if there is no "NA", "Neutral", "This doesn't apply to me" or something similar to that response, they don't know how to answer that question and it can skew the results. Make sure that each person taking the survey, no matter where they might fit into things, has a relevant response to them, and not just a guess or closest answer.

#### Avoid grids / matrices as much as possible

While matrices may seem like a good shortcut to getting many questions into a smaller space, these can sometimes be confusing for survey takers and often discourages survey completion. In addition, the format of matrices can often get warped on mobile devices, making it more difficult for the survey taker. So as much as possible, break these out into separate questions.

#### Make sure response options are mutually exclusive

If you are asking someone to select one from a list of responses, make sure that there is no overlap between any of the responses, or that multiple can't apply to one person. For example, if you are asking for someone's age and you provide ranges, make sure it is not "20-30; 30-40; 40-50" because someone that is 30 will not know how to answer this. Instead use: "20-29; 30-39; 40-49"

#### If possible, have the survey come from a known email address

Often when mass emails are sent out, that email might come from a more generic or automated email address. This makes people less likely to open the email and even less likely to click on a link inside. So whenever possible, have that survey come from a known and trusted email address.

#### Always preview and test the survey

Go through and look at the survey as a survey taker will see it. Also, go through and take the survey to make sure the flow is correct and questions all make sense. If possible, also ask some others to take it as well to see if they notice any issues or if something doesn't make sense to them. Someone without as much background will notice things that don't make as much sense in the questions.
