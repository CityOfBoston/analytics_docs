# Data Platform

We use a tool called [Civis Platform](tools/civis-platform.md) for everything from querying/analyzing data to building automated pipelines, visualizations, and models.

## How Data is Data Organized

### **Data Classification**

All data stored in our data platform will be classified into one of the below three access level types, in accordance with our Data Governance Policy. 

####     Open data

* No restrictions on internal use by any user of the platform or City of Boston employee. 
* Any data already shared on the [Analyze Boston](open-data.md) portal is classified as open data. However, not all data in open data schemas are published on Analyze Boston, it must first go through a [separate approval process](https://bostonopendata.knack.com/opendataapprovalpublication#processoverview/). All squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.

####     Internal data \(default classification level\)

* No restrictions on internal use by members of the Analytics team.
* Users from other teams must request access to each internal data schema they want, the data owner will approve the request prior to the requesting team being granted access. 

####     Restricted data

* Anyone, including all members of the Analytics team, have to request access on a table by table basis from the data owner using the [Data Access Request Form](https://bostonopendata.knack.com/DAR#home/). 

{% hint style="info" %}
An administrator of the Civis Platform can see all the data stored in the platform. By nature, the administrator role is designed to have full access.
{% endhint %}

### Schema Naming Conventions

* All schema names align with the above Data Classification categories. 
* The prefix of each schema designates the department or project to which the data belongs. 
  * Data owned by the Environment department will be held in schemas prefixed with `env_` , and followed by `internal_data`, `open_data`, or `restricted_data` to correspond with access levels outlined above. 
  * Data coming from the 311 system doesn't have a designated department owner outside of DoIT, so it is prefixed with `lagan_311_` to indicate the project name. Same for Hansen/IPS data, is prefixed with `hansen_` instead of `[department]_hansen_`. 
  * Data owned and generated by the Analytics Team is held in schemas prefixed with `analytics_` . 
  * In addition to the normal schemas, there is a `sandbox` schema meant for ad hoc and testing purposes of the Analytics Team.
* As a member of the Analytics Team, you would have full read access to any table in any `*_open_data` and `*_internal_data` schemas. 
* All `restricted_data` tables are on a person by person access only, you must request it for yourself for a specific project. More details [here](). 
* All members of the Analytics Team can write to the sandbox schema. Please read the [Table Naming Guide]() before creating tables.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Any table in `sandbox` is subject to deletion at any time - please do not build visualizations or automations on these tables. Also, storage of restricted data is **not allowed** in the `sandbox` schema.
{% endhint %}

### I'm new to all of this. How do just I find a table I want to look at? 

We are in the process of building out a data documentation site built automatically from our data unit tests. Until then, you can explore the schemas available to you in the left pane in Civis.

If you still can't find anything, begin asking around. Start in Engineering. To get faster answers, bring candy.
