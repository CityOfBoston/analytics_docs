# Communication

As an organization that focuses on diversity and inclusion in the workspace, we hire great people with a variety of perspectives, cultural backgrounds, and experiences. Because of this and our move to remote work, it's important for us now more than ever to practice clear communication so that we can stay connected and work more efficiently.

## General Communication Guidelines

**Tips:**

* Be present and focused on listening
* Consider the culture of the receiver
* It's nice to be nice
* When in doubt, give the benefit of the doubt

## Communication Channels

Different types of communication have different channels and we use these different channels based on the complexity of the subject and how important it is to reduce the probability of miscommunication.

Our rule here is; **as complexity or sensitivity of the subject or relationship increases, so, too, should the richness of the technology** \(e.g., from email to face-to-face\). The "richness" of the technology refers to how much information is communicated between the participants and a higher richness lowers the probability of miscommunication.

## Internal Communication

### [Slack](tools/slack.md)

The Analytics Team primarily uses these channels on Slack:

* [\#analytics](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/C08ETUZ18) is the primary channel for all of DoIT's data and analysis conversations. This is where people from other teams can link to their issues, ask for help, direction, and get general feedback from members of the Analytics Team.
* [\#analytics\_team\_only](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/CRV64J8BF) is where the team can have internal discussions.
* [\#analytics\_wfh](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/G010BR5PUV6) is where we report status updates on what we've accomplished at the end of each day.
* [\#appreciation-wall](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/C01GYQK3KD5) is a place to give recognition to a fellow co-worker who embodies [our team values](https://docs.boston.gov/analytics/team/mission-vision-values#our-values).
* [\#civis](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/CE69C27F0) is for anything related to the civis platform.
* [\#civis\_pipelines\_pr](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/C01LRUDL5M1) is where slack logs the status of pull requests on our data pipelines repo: [civis\_pipelines](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/civis_pipelines)
* [\#data-engineering](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/CB1QSMM3M) is where the Data Engineering team collaborates.
* [\#general](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/C08CEPRS5) is a DoIT-wide channel for general updates on what is happening in the department.
* [\#maps](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/C5C9AHZ29) is a channel where various teams collaborate on GIS and map projects.
* [\#projectmanagement](https://cityofboston-doit.slack.com/archives/G010SNHSFMH) is where the Analytics Team project managers discuss incoming priorities.

### Email Contact Groups/Distribution Lists

### [GitHub](https://github.com/)

You can tag the Analytics Team in GitHub using:

* [@CityOfBoston/analytics-team](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfBoston/teams/analytics-team) - this notifies the entire Analytics Team
* [@CityOfBoston/data-engineering-team](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfBoston/teams/data-engineering-team) - this notifies just the Data Engineers

## Reaching a Consensus

### Five-Finger Voting \(or 1-5 Voting\)

* 1 finger - I believe this decision is extremely damaging and I will block consensus.
* 2 fingers - I believe this is the wrong decision but I will not block it.
* 3 fingers - I somewhat agree but I have some questions/reservations I'd like to discuss first.
* 4 fingers - This is a good decision.
* 5 fingers - I believe this is the best possible decision and I'm prepared to own the project.
