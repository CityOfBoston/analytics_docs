## Creating new documentation

{% hint style="warning" %}
All documentation must follow our [data security policy](https://docs.boston.gov/analytics/guides/employee-handbook/security#data-security-policy). Please familiarize yourself before publishing any documentation.
{% endhint %}

### Where should it go?

We store most documentation under guides which include both guides on **how** to take specific actions as well as documentation on **what** a subject is. We've tried to make the top-level pages general enough to fit things into but if you don't believe it makes sense, you can store it under an "Other" page or create a new top-level page after voting on it.

We also have an [internal documentation](https://docs.boston.gov/analytics-internal/) site for anything that fits the internal data specification in the [data security policy](https://docs.boston.gov/analytics/guides/employee-handbook/security#data-security-policy).
