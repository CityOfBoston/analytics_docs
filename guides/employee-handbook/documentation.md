## Creating new documentation

{% hint style="danger" %}
All documentation must follow our [data security policy](https://docs.boston.gov/analytics/guides/employee-handbook/security#data-security-policy). Please familiarize yourself before publishing any documentation.

**Never** document passwords or personally identifiable information \(PII\). Server names are allowed but only in the [Analytics internal documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/@boston/s/analytics-internal/).
{% endhint %}

### Where should it go?

First, think about who the intended audience is for what you will be writing. Generally, the top-level pages are meant for all audiences. As you drill down into pages, the audience becomes more specific. Please try to limit nesting pages to no more than 3 levels deep. The majority of new documentation will likely fall under the [employee handbook](./), [tools](tools/), or [projects](../../projects/more-projects.md).

We also have an [internal documentation](https://docs.boston.gov/analytics-internal/) site for anything that fits the internal data specification in the [data security policy](https://docs.boston.gov/analytics/guides/employee-handbook/security#data-security-policy).
