# Getting Started

## Computer Setup

### Desktop Software

### VPN and Remote Connections

For certain tasks, you may need to be connected to the City's network. In order to do this, follow our [VPN and Remote Connection Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PRT5CnT9ugjEDVzB43GHc0YT3HWcOobQHpMybkqdFfE/edit#).

## Credentials

All credentials are stored in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home?region=us-east-1#/listSecrets) which allows you to search by name, description, and tags. You will only be able to access credentials available to your role which is set up by the time you are able to log in.
