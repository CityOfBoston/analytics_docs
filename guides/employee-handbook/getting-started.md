# Getting Started

## Computer Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to install additional software, email [doitservicedesk@boston.gov](mailto:doitservicedesk@boston.gov) and ask for permission by sending them the specific program you are trying to install, and why.
{% endhint %}

### VPN and Remote Connections

For certain tasks, you may need to be connected to the City's network. In order to do this, follow our [VPN and Remote Connection Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PRT5CnT9ugjEDVzB43GHc0YT3HWcOobQHpMybkqdFfE/edit#).

## Credentials

All credentials are stored in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home?region=us-east-1#/listSecrets) which allows you to search by name, description, and tags. You will only be able to access credentials available to your role which is set up by the time you are able to log in.

{% hint style="info" %}
Having issues with finding/storing credentials? Contact our [Data Platform Engineer](../../team/employee-directory.md#data-engineering) for assistance.
