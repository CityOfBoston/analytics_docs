# Meetings

## Meeting Roles

We have roles specifically for meetings that help us achieve our goals and distribute responsibilities in a fair manner. Each of these roles is rotating which means that a new member will be assigned one of the roles before each meeting. You can use [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x3cZvN\_cSlZwnyZnpbymhU1rJiQfTz4ZsgRv-BdIhS8/edit#gid=0) for randomly assigning roles.

### Team Leader/Facilitator

The team leader is responsible for making sure the goals of a meeting are clear and that the objectives of the meeting are met.

**Responsibilities:**

* Setting the agenda.
* Keeping the conversation focused on meeting objectives.
* Keeping track of time.
* Making sure participants get an equal amount of talking time.
* If it's a recurring meeting, assigning roles for the next meeting.

### Scribe

The scribe is responsible for documenting the key ideas and outcomes from the meeting.

## Indicators of a bad meeting

### A few people dominating the discussion

When there are one or two people talking the entire meeting it's usually safe to say that the rest of the people in the meeting are wondering _"why am I here?"_ We want to be deliberate in how we structure meetings to take advantage of the unique experience and expertise each member brings.

{% hint style="success" %}
When everyone gets equal time to talk, it's a sign of a good meeting.
{% endhint %}

### Discussing what the meeting should be about

This is an indicator that either the meeting wasn't planned or the purpose wasn't clear. We want to make sure time spent in a meeting goes solely towards the objective at hand.

{% hint style="success" %}
When the meeting objective is clear, we can focus on achieving our goals.
{% endhint %}
