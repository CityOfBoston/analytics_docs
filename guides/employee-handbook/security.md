# Security

## Connecting to the Internet üåê

The City's wifi for employees is called **cob-employee**. Please **DO NOT** use the City's free wifi **Wicked Free Wifi** to perform City of Boston work because any open wifi is inherently vulnerable to attacks.

{% hint style="info" %}
All internet browsing activity is monitored for security. This includes personal devices.
{% endhint %}

## Everything is Public Record üì¢

Anyone at any time can request a copy of all emails, chat records, code (including GitBook), etc. the City of Boston sends/creates through a [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.foia.gov) (FOIA) request.\
\
Please keep all conversations over gmail and google chat directly related to City of Boston work.

## Sharing Passwords üîê

Related to the section above, we must make sure we keep passwords secure by not sending them directly over email or chat. Instead, please use [one time secret](https://onetimesecret.com) to send sensitive information. OTS will let you create a link to sensitive information that can only be viewed once which greatly reduces the risk that an unauthorized person accesses our passwords.

## Downloading Programs üë©‚Äçüíª

Especially when downloading packages for programming, it can be easy to step away from a security-first mindset. Always keep in mind that even seemingly harmless python packages may contain dangerous viruses, so be on the lookout of any suspicious networking activity, and never autopilot downloading software.

## Data Security Policy

Data is secured by defined sensitivity levels and all data (including our documentation) must abide by these rules. Please read the latest guidelines below. If you are unsure what classification some data falls under, please contact the security team.
