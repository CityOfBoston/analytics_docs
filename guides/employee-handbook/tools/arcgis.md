### Hosted Feature Layer

#### How to create a new hosted feature layer via ArcGIS Online

1. Create a CSV file from the dataset you wish to use.
2. Log into [Boston Maps](../../gis.md#boston-maps) and navigate to the [Content](https://boston.maps.arcgis.com/home/content.html) section. If you want this layer to be updated via a Civis workflow then please use the **etldevelopers\_boston** service account.
3. In the top left, choose **Add Item** &gt; **From your computer**
   1. Titles must be unique & tags are required. We usually use CSV and anything else appropriate.
   2. Once you've uploaded a CSV file you'll notice a checkbox with **Publish this file as a hosted layer** selected. Keep it selected.
4. Assuming your dataset has geospatial columns and it correctly recognized those columns you can leave the rest as is and choose **Add Item**.
