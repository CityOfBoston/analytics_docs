### [Hosted Feature Layer](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/hosted-web-layers.htm)

A hosted feature layer is the basic [building block](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/data-in-online.htm) of the maps we create. In a map, you can use multiple layers of data to overlay information.

#### How to create a new hosted feature layer via ArcGIS Online

1. Create a CSV file from the dataset you wish to use.
2. Log into [Boston Maps](../../gis.md#boston-maps) and navigate to the [Content](https://boston.maps.arcgis.com/home/content.html) section. If you want this layer to be updated via a Civis workflow then please use the **etldevelopers\_boston** service account.
3. In the top left, choose **Add Item** &gt; **From your computer**
   1. Titles must be unique & tags are required. We usually use CSV and anything else appropriate.
   2. Once you've uploaded a CSV file you'll notice a checkbox with **Publish this file as a hosted layer** selected. Keep it selected.
4. Assuming your dataset has geospatial columns and it correctly recognized those columns you can leave the rest as is and choose **Add Item**.

#### How to overwrite a hosted feature layer via ArcGIS Online

1. Find the hosted feature layer you'd like to update by searching the [Content](https://boston.maps.arcgis.com/home/content.html) section.
2. On the right, choose **Update Data** &gt; **Overwrite Entire Layer** then follow the instructions.
