# DBeaver

## Overview

We use the [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) community edition for connecting to various types of databases and querying/editing data and database structures. To get started, head over to their website and download the latest version for your computer and then follow the install instructions.

The most common database types that we use DBeaver for are PostgreSQL and MSSQL.
