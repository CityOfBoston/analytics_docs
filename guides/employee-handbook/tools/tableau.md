## [Tableau Server](https://dashboard.cityofboston.gov/#/site/Analytics/home)

Tableau server is used to publish and share Tableau dashboards and is organized by sites which have different sets of users, permissions, and settings according to their use. 

The City has three server administrators: Stefanie Costa Leabo, Cyrus Leghvan \(Qlarion\), and Sam Lovison. 

### Tableau Server Sites

* **Administrator**

### Tableau Site Organization

  * Top-level projects are organized by the department, program or team building their own Tableau dashboards \(ex. Energy, ISD, BPL\)
    * Each top-level project should have a corresponding user group, and top-level project permissions should be restricted to only that user group so that users only see their own content
