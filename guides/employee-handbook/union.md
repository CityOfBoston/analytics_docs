## [Weingarten Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weingarten_Rights)

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the National Labor Relations Act gives workers the right to request union representation during investigatory interviews by superiors, security personnel and other managerial staff. These are called Weingarten Rights.

An investigatory interview occurs if 1\) management questions you to obtain information; and 2\) you have reasonable belief that your answers could be used as a base for discipline or other adverse action.

You must ask for union representation either before or during an investigatory interview. Management does not have to remind you of this right.

If your request is refused and management continues asking questions, you may refuse to answer. Your employer is guilty of unfair labor practice and charges may be filed.

If you are questioned in a situation where Weingarten may apply, read or present the statement below.

### Request for union representation

_If you are called to a meeting with management, read the following or present this statement when the meeting begins._

> If this interview could in any way lead to my being disciplined or terminated or affect my personal working conditions, I respectfully request that my union representative, officer or steward be present at this meeting. Until my representative arrives, I choose not to participate in this discussion.
