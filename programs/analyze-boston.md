As one of his first acts in office, Mayor Martin J. Walsh signed An Act Relative to Open Data and Protected Data Sharing, an [Executive Order](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/cob-executive-order-open-data-4-7-2014) declaring the City of Boston’s commitment to participation, transparency, collaboration, and engagement--the core principles of [Open Government](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/transparency-and-open-government). By July 2015, the City’s first [Open and Protected Data Policy](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/open-and-protected-data-policy/resource/55dff33c-4b53-462f-b4c9-af51a81c7273) was issued to provide citywide guidance toward the implementation of services and programs toward this commitment.

Through support from the Knight Foundation, the City of Boston formed its first Open Data Team. Identifying their primary goal as making ‘open data a key component of \[the City of Boston’s] overall data infrastructure and workflows,’ the Open Data Team began work on three key initiatives in 2016:

1. **Inventory + catalog.** The Team took on the task of identifying and cataloging as many of the City’s datasets as possible. To accomplish this task, the Team led two cross-departmental Data Summits in 2016 in partnership with the Boston Public Library.
2. **Open Data Portal 2.0.** The Team procured and implemented [Analyze Boston](https://data.boston.gov), the digital infrastructure through which City datasets are opened and shared with the public. The Analyze Boston portal went live in April 2017.
3. **Open Data curriculum.** In partnership with the Engagement Lab at Emerson College, the Team developed an open data curriculum meant to be delivered to the City’s librarians. This curriculum helped orient librarians to the concept of open data, the Analyze Boston portal, and ways in which the public might utilize City open datasets to help answer questions they might have about the City and beyond.

Specifically, the curriculum helped address three major barriers to data:&#x20;

1. **Absent metadata.** As part of the curriculum, librarians helped create ‘Civic Data Guides’ to provide context to each dataset.
2. **Data illiteracy.** One goal of the curriculum was to help librarians become more data literate so that they might help patrons become more data literate as well, and
3. **Poor connectivity.** In conjunction with the City’s dedication to improving digital and data equity, delivery of the curriculum through the public library system was identified as a way to deliver meaningful information and knowledge of open datasets to the public.

In mid-2017, the City of Boston’s work on open data was paused with the search for a new manager of the work. In November 2019, with the hiring of a new Open Data Manager, the opportunity for renewed and innovative commitment to open data has presented itself, and the Citywide Analytics Team is poised to take open data to new levels of success.

## **Vision**

Aligned with Mayor Walsh’s 2014 Executive Order, the original impetus for the City of Boston’s work in open data, our commitment to the core principles of Open Government--participation, transparency, collaboration, and engagement--remains intact.

We envision a city where City of Boston processes are both easily available and easily accessible to the public for the purposes of not simply sharing and informing, but also for co-production and active engagement and participation in City of Boston processes. A city is nothing without its people; we consider our commitment to Open Government an active invitation to the people of Boston to shape their city.

Because of this vision, we rely on the following values to guide our future initiatives and actions:

* **We value transparency.** Government processes belong to the public. We are committed to the continued opening of data to the public.
* **We recognize that transparency is not enough.** Availability of data is not enough to produce true transparency. In addition to opening data, we are committed to creating equitable, accessible paths to understanding and using the data we make public.
* **We believe that the public good and individual privacy must be balanced.** While much of our data does not carry personally-identifying information (PII), some of it does. We are committed to protecting individual privacy, and this means that we must continually revisit our processes and principles regarding open data in order to preserve individual rights to privacy as well as public trust.

## **Clarifications**

There has been enough movement around Open Data in the City of Boston in the past several years that it warrants clarifying what some things in the City’s Open Data world are:

* Open Government is a set of principles and values regarding the ways in which government can and should relate to its constituents. In the City of Boston, we directly subscribe to the idea of Open Government and have [directly tied the concept of Open Government](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/cob-executive-order-open-data-4-7-2014) to the principles of participation, transparency, collaboration, and engagement.
* Open Data is tied to, but [distinct from,](https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/discourse/59-11.pdf) Open Government. Open Data is the idea and act of believing that some data should be both available and accessible to all. In the City of Boston, we believe in the concept of Open Data, and we believe that there needs to be a [balance between opening data for public use and protection of individual privacy.](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/open-and-protected-data-policy/resource/55dff33c-4b53-462f-b4c9-af51a81c7273)
* Analyze Boston is the City of Boston’s Open Data platform--the specific digital location (data.boston.gov) where the public can download datasets that have been made open by the City of Boston.
* Civic Data is the actual use of data (both publicly available data and otherwise) toward furthering the public good.

Therefore...

* Open Government and Open Data are values and principles that the City of Boston subscribes to.
* Analyze Boston is the tool through which the City of Boston delivers Open Data.
* Civic Data is the set of actions that the public take to use data as a tool to further the public good.

## **Goals**

For Open Data 2.0, the primary goal was to make ‘open data a key component of \[the City of Boston’s] overall data infrastructure and workflows.’

In 2019, we have extended and evolved this goal for Open Data 3.0:&#x20;

Our goal is to make Open Data truly usable for all stakeholders in and beyond the City of Boston.

This goal will be accomplished through:

* Improving data quality. There’s a saying that goes something like ‘garbage in, garbage out.’ When our data are of poor quality, our data can’t be used. Data quality can improve in several ways, including:
  * Identifying new fields to add to existing datasets
  * Providing metadata and field descriptions to provide context to data
  * Adding data quality checks to automated data pipelines
* Improving data access. From day one, we have been committed to data availability, but data access means much more. Beyond access to quality data (see above) and access to data translation (see below), access to data might look like:
  * Automation of datasets
  * Cleaning up current datasets
  * Identification and opening of new datasets
  * Expansion of datasets to include new forms of data
  * Standardization of data fields across datasets
  * Standardization of datasets across cities
  * Navigation of Analyze Boston to find the right dataset(s)
* Building bridges between data and action. Data by itself does not produce action. We need to participate in bridge-building between data and the people who want to use it. Bridge building can occur in several ways, including:
  * Building skills that allow individuals to manipulate data so that they can begin to answer their questions
  * Building tools to manipulate data in specific ways or for specific reasons
  * Building pathways to additional, related information provided by the City of Boston
  * Building relationships to translate data or to translate needs into questions answerable with data
  * Building spaces where tools can be used and/or where relationships can be forged and sustained
* Interrogating the balance between openness and privacy. The balance between the provision of data and the protection of data is not easy to strike. We recognize that as technology and cities change, this balance--and our understanding thereof--will need to be revisited on a constant and consistent basis. Interrogation of these ideas might look like:
  * Revisiting policies to bring them up-to-date, given advances in technology and a changing government
  * Keeping up on current best practices and engaging in cross-city and national conversations on open data and data privacy
  * Inviting City of Boston staff and the public in grappling with the balance between openness and privacy

## **Defining Success**

Quality - automation in both delivery of data and data quality testing

Documentation of work

Success might be measured by:

* % of automated pipelines
* Knack status
* Knack time between steps
* \# of boston.gov tools built on top of open data
* Google analytics for Analyze Boston
* Listserv subscribers--internal, external
