# ðŸš© Mission, Vision, Values

## Our Mission

Through a better understanding and usage of data, we work to increase the quality of life for residents and to enhance our government. Our analysis and visualizations focus on improving how the City operates. We work with City departments to: 

* solve challenging problems
* build a more effective government
* deliver better outcomes for people who live and work in Boston.

## Our Vision

To use data to improve quality of life and to enhance government operations in the City of Boston.

## Our Values

### Build for the Future

Our goal is to create sustainable solutions that will withstand organizational and technological change.

### Make Change Less Painful

Our work should be easy to understand, use, adopt, and champion in order to empower others to become self-sufficient in using data. Changing the way people work is hard, and we can't do it alone.

### Be Open

We strive to make data better understood - by ourselves and our stakeholders. We clearly communicate our understanding and assumptions about the data we use and share.

### Question, Evaluate, Repeat

We want our work to be impactful. We regularly question what our intent is, measure and quantify as much as possible, and consider the consequences of our work.

### Expertise is Everywhere

We respect and listen to the perspectives, experience, and subject matter expertise of our colleagues and stakeholders, and make an effort to understand the goals, situations, frustrations, limitations, and challenges of the people, processes and technology we work with.
